        <h1>Privacy Policy for WELLTEST (SWT/DAQ App)</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which <strong>WELLTEST (SWT/DAQ App)</strong> (referred to as "the App"), developed by <strong>Suhendi Hamim</strong> (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information from users (referred to as "you" or "user") of the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The WELLTEST (SWT/DAQ App) is designed to perform well test calculations, data conversions, and related functionalities based on user-provided input. <strong>The App does not directly collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from users, nor does it transmit any user data to our servers or any third-party servers.</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Inputted Data:</strong> Data that you enter into the App (e.g., Choke size, WHP, WHT, calculation parameters, results) is processed and <strong>stored locally on your device</strong>. This local storage is essential for the App's core functionality, allowing you to save, retrieve, and manage your calculation records within the App for your convenience. This data is not accessible by us or any third parties unless you explicitly choose to share it.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Services/SDKs:</strong> Our App utilizes various third-party Flutter packages/SDKs to provide essential functionalities and enhance user experience. These SDKs are chosen for their specific utility and <strong>do not collect or transmit user PII for advertising, analytics, or other purposes beyond their designated operational scope within the App's core features.</strong> Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hive & Hive Flutter:</strong> Used for local, on-device data storage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Syncfusion Flutter SignaturePad:</strong> Facilitates local digital signature capture.</li>
                    <li><strong>PDF & Printing packages:</strong> Used for local PDF report generation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Share_plus:</strong> Enables native device sharing functionality <em>initiated by the user</em>.</li>
                    <li><em>Other SDKs (e.g., <code>intl</code>, <code>open_filex</code>, <code>uuid</code>, <code>data_table_2</code>)</em> are used for internal app functionality and UI enhancements.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Information is Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> The user-inputted data and calculation results stored locally on your device are used exclusively to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Perform the App's core calculation and conversion functionalities.</li>
                    <li>Allow you to save, retrieve, modify, and manage your welltest records within the App.</li>
                    <li>Generate local PDF reports based on your data.</li>
                    <li>Personalize your in-app settings and preferences.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Third-party SDKs are used solely to enable the functionalities for which they were integrated (e.g., displaying tables, generating PDFs, providing sharing options), without independent collection or use of your PII.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not share any information that we collect directly, as we do not collect PII.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Initiated Sharing:</strong> The App provides a feature to allow you to share generated PDF reports or other App content using your device's native sharing capabilities (e.g., email, messaging apps). Any data you choose to share through this user-initiated action is subject to the privacy policies and terms of the receiving application or service, not ours. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party applications you choose to share data with.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the information stored locally on your device from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>As we do not directly collect or transmit PII from users, we do not retain such data on our servers. User-inputted data and calculation results are retained locally on your device until you choose to delete them through the App's interface. Data collected by third-party services, if any, for their operational purposes, would be subject to their respective data retention policies.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without verified parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
